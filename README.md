# Dolby Atmos DBMD Parser (dbmd_atmos_parse)
# version 1.0

dbmd_atmos_parse is a command line utility that parses the Dolby Audio Metadata (DBMD) chunk in a Dolby Atmos Audio Definition Model (ADM) WAV file. The tool displays the status of some Dolby Atmos metadata, including:

- Headphone rendering metadata

- Trim metadata per output speaker configuration

- Warp mode setting

The primary purpose of this code is to help users that need to assess the state of the metadata in an ADM WAV file. Note that this tool only parses the Dolby Atmos metadata segments in the DBMD chunk, it does not parse the ADM XML.

For more information see the release notes.
